AI USAGE - DEEP guidelines

If AI was used in preparing this issue, please fill in the section below.
Our DEEP guidelines ask that when using AI you:

  Disclose - Be open about when you've used AI for support.
  Engage critically - Question what is generated. Verify claims and sources.
  Edit - Digest and refine AI output rather than copy-pasting it.
  Process sharing - Explain how you used the AI so others can learn.

Examples of good disclosures:

  "I used Gemini to help draft this issue from my rough notes. I edited
  the description for accuracy, confirmed the reproduction steps myself,
  and trimmed the verbose output."

  "This is based on a Claude summary of clearinghouse feedback. I
  cross-checked the key points against the original feedback and rewrote
  the requirements in my own words."
