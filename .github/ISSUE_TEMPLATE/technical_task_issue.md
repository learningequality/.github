<!--
Instructions:
- Fill in Overview, The Change, and Acceptance Criteria (required)
- Delete any optional sections you don't need
- Remove all instructional comments before submitting
-->

## Overview

<!--
Describe what needs to be done and why.
Keep it brief - a few sentences.
-->

**Complexity:** Low | Medium | High

### Context

<!--
OPTIONAL - Delete if not needed.

Provide background needed to understand the task:
- For bugs: current behavior, code snippets, error messages
- For frontend work: screenshots of current state
- For refactors: relevant existing implementation details

Do NOT provide the solution - equip the developer to find it.
-->

### The Change

<!--
Describe what needs to change and the general direction.
- For frontend new features: include screenshots/mockups of desired end state
- For backend work: describe the expected behavior, not the implementation

Focus on WHAT and WHY, less on HOW. The developer determines the implementation, but if this needs to fit into a specific broader architecture, constraints, or codebase standard patterns, this should be included.
-->

### How to Get There

<!--
OPTIONAL - Delete if not needed.

For frontend or user-facing changes:
- Navigation steps to reach the relevant UI
- Steps to reproduce a bug

For backend:
- How to trigger the relevant code path
-->

### Out of Scope

<!--
OPTIONAL - Delete if not needed.

Explicitly list what should NOT be changed as part of this task.
Helps prevent scope creep and keeps PRs focused.
-->

### Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Checklist of requirements for the task to be considered complete.
All items should be verifiable.

For frontend tasks, consider adding subsections:
#### General
#### Accessibility and i18n
#### Testing

For backend tasks, consider:
#### General
#### Testing

### Testing

<!--
OPTIONAL - Delete if not needed.

Specific test commands or manual verification steps.
Only include if there are task-specific testing requirements
beyond what's in Acceptance Criteria.
-->

### References

<!--
OPTIONAL - Delete if not needed.

Links to documentation, code references, or relevant libraries.

AI USAGE - DEEP guidelines

If AI was used in preparing this issue, please fill in the section below.
Our DEEP guidelines ask that when using AI you:

  Disclose - Be open about when you've used AI for support.
  Engage critically - Question what is generated. Verify claims and sources.
  Edit - Digest and refine AI output rather than copy-pasting it.
  Process sharing - Explain how you used the AI so others can learn.

Examples of good disclosures:

  "I used Gemini to help draft this issue from my rough notes. I edited
  the description for accuracy, confirmed the reproduction steps myself,
  and trimmed the verbose output."

  "This is based on a Claude summary of clearinghouse feedback. I
  cross-checked the key points against the original feedback and rewrote
  the requirements in my own words."
