AI USAGE - DEEP guidelines

If AI was used in preparing this PR, please fill in the section below.
Our DEEP guidelines ask that when using AI you:

  Disclose - Be open about when you've used AI for support.
  Engage critically - Question what is generated. Review code for correctness and unnecessary complexity.
  Edit - Review and refine AI output. Remove unnecessary code and verify it still works after your edits.
  Process sharing - Explain how you used the AI so others can learn.

Examples of good disclosures:

  "I used Claude Code to implement the component, prompting it to follow
  the pattern in ComponentX. I reviewed the generated code, removed
  unnecessary error handling, and verified the tests pass."

  "I brainstormed the approach with Gemini, then had it write failing
  tests for the feature. After reviewing the tests, I used Claude Code
  to generate the implementation. I refactored the output to reduce
  verbosity and ran the full test suite."
